Cleaning and disinfection remain one of the most effective biosecurity measures to prevent and control the spread of ASFV. In this study, we evaluated the inactivation effects of highly complexed iodine (HPCI) combined with compound organic acids (COAs) against ASFV under different conditions. The results showed that the inactivation rates of the disinfectants on the reporter ASFV increased in dose- and time-dependent manners, the best inactivation effects were obtained when the compatibility ratio of HPCI and COAs was 5:1 at 25{degrees}C. Furthermore, there were no significant differences by comparing the efficacy of HPCI combined with COAs (HPCI+COAs) in inactivating wild-type ASFV and the reporter ASFV (P > 0.05). ASFV of 104.0 TCID50/mL was completely inactivated by 0.13% HPCI (0.0065% effective iodine), 0.06% COAs or 0.13% HPCI+COAs (approximately 0.0054% effective iodine), respectively, while 106.0 TCID50/mL ASFV was completely inactivated by 1.00% HPCI (0.05% effective iodine), 0.50% COAs or 1.00% HPCI+COAs (0.042% effective iodine), respectively. Therefore, HPCI+COAs had synergistic effects to inactivate ASFV. This study demonstrated that HPCI+COAs could rapidly and efficiently inactivate ASFV and represent an effective compound disinfectant for the control of ASF.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEAfrican swine fever (ASF) is a highly contagious disease with high morbidity and mortality caused by African swine fever virus (ASFV). Due to the lack of commercial vaccines and treatment available for ASF, effective disinfectants and the proper use of them are extremely essential to inactivate ASFV. The significance of this research is in searching for an ideal disinfectant that not only has the advantages of low toxicity and non-pollution but also can inactivate ASFV rapidly and efficiently. In this study, we proved that HPCI+COAs not only exhibited low cytotoxicity, but also could completely inactivate ASFV within 5 min at 4{degrees}C, 25{degrees}C and 37{degrees}C. In addition, HPCI+COAs had synergistic effects on inactivated ASFV. Thus, HPCI +COAs could be used as an effective disinfectant for the control of ASF.', 'published': 'NA', 'node': 7633, 'link_page': 'https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.10.475769v1?versioned=TRUE', 'link_pdf': 'https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.10.475769v1.full.pdf'}\n",

Leptolyngbya boryana is the filamentous cyanobacterial species, which has been used as a genetic model organism for studying metabolism including photosynthesis and nitrogen-fixation. Although a widely used type strain (wild type) of this species has not been reported to show any motile activity, we isolated a spontaneous mutant strain which shows active motility (gliding activity) to give rise to complicated colony patters, including comet-like wandering clusters and disk-like rotating vortices on solid media. Whole-genome resequencing identified multiple mutations on the genome in the mutant strain. We confirmed that inactivation of a candidate gene, dgc2 (LBDG_02920), in the wild type background was sufficient to give rise to motility and the morphological colony patterns. This gene encodes a protein, containing the GGDEF motif, which is conserved at the catalytic domain of diguanylate cyclase (DGC). Although DGC has been reported to be involved in biofilm formation, the mutant strain lacking dgc2 significantly facilitated biofilm formation, suggesting a role of DGC for suppressing both gliding motility and biofilm formation. Thus, L. boryana provides an excellent genetic model to study dynamic colony pattern formation, and novel insight on a role of c-di-GMP for biofilm formation.\\n\\nImportanceSelf-propelled bacteria often show complicated collective behaviors, such as the formation of dense moving clusters, which is exemplified by wandering comet-like and rotating disk-like colonies, while molecular details of forming such structures remain limited. We found that a strain deficient in the diguanylate cyclase gene dgc2 in the filamentous cyanobacterium L. boryana induces motility, complex and dynamic colony pattern formation including the comet-like and disk-like clusters. While c-di-GMP has been reported to activate biofilm formation in some bacterial species, disruption of the dgc2 gene unexpectedly enhanced it, providing a novel role for c-di-GMP regulatory system in both colony pattern formation and biofilm formation.', 'published': 'NA', 'node': 7634, 'link_page': 'https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.10.475764v1?versioned=TRUE', 'link_pdf': 'https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.10.475764v1.full.pdf'}\n",

These assignments are species specific, and depend on the practitioner. Legacy multilocus sequence typing is commonly used to identify sequence types (STs) and clusters (ST Complexes). However, these approaches are not adequate for the millions of genomic sequences from bacterial pathogens that have been generated since 2012. EnteroBase (http://enterobase.warwick.ac.uk) automatically clusters core genome MLST allelic profiles into hierarchical clusters (HierCC) after assembling annotated draft genomes from short read sequences. HierCC clusters span core sequence diversity from the species level down to individual transmission chains.

The effect of Anise, Fennel, Sweet orange, Basil, Coriander, Oregano, Peppermint, Mugwort, Rosemary and Thyme EOs were studied on five strains of T. evanescens. Specific experimental setups were developed, and data obtained from image analysis were interpreted with phenomenological models fitted with Bayesian inference. Results highlight the fumigant toxicity of EOs on parasitoid development. Anise, Fennel, Basil, Coriander, Oregano, Peppermint and Thyme EOs are particularly toxic and drastically reduce the emergence rate of T. evanescens. Most EOs also affect parasitoid behavior: (i) Basil, Coriander, Oregano, Peppermint, Mugwort and Thyme EOs are highly repellent for naive female parasitoids; (ii) Anise and Fennel EOs can have repellent or attractive effects depending on strains; and (iii) Sweet orange, Oregano and Rosemary EOs have no detectable impact on orientation behavior.

In most Drosophila species, the male genitalia is symmetric and undergoes a clockwise 360{degrees} rotation during development. In D. melanogaster, this tissue remodeling process is directed by class I myosins: in MyoID mutants the rotation is reversed and the genitalia remains symmetric. Males of Drosophila pachea have evolved unique left-right asymmetric genital organs and a characteristic right-sided copulation posture in the past 3-6 million years. To test if these asymmetries in morphology and behavior evolved via the recruitment of pre-existing directional cues controlled by MyoID, we used CRISPR to knockout MyoID in D. pachea. Strikingly, mutant males undergo a reverse genitalia rotation and develop mirror-image asymmetric genitalia, indicating that MyoID controls both the direction of genitalia rotation direction and morphological asymmetry. Although genital asymmetry is reversed, MyoID mutants still adopt a wild-type right-sided copulation posture. Our results show that MyoID and its asymmetry guidance role were recruited for the evolution of a novel left-right asymmetry in D. pachea and that lateralized copulation behavior is determined by other mechanisms.

This requires interpreting the variations and, in many occasions, producing changes in gene expression. In this paper we use information theory and a simple transcription model to analyze the extent to which the resulting gene expression is able to identify and assess the intensity of extracellular stimuli when they are encoded in the amplitude, duration or frequency of a transcription factors nuclear concentration. We find that the maximal information transmission is, for the three codifications, ~ 1.5 - 1.8 bits, i.e., approximately 3 ranges of input strengths can be distinguished in all cases. The types of promoters that yield maximum transmission for the three modes are all similarly fast and have a high activation threshold. The three input modulation modes differ, however, in the sensitivity to changes in the parameters that characterize the promoters, with frequency modulation being the most sensitive and duration modulation, the least. This turns out to be key for signal identification. Namely, we show that, because of this sensitivity difference, it is possible to find promoter parameters that yield an information transmission within 90% of its maximum value for duration or amplitude modulation and less than 1 bit for frequency modulation. The reverse situation cannot be found within the framework of a single promoter transcription model. This means that pulses of transcription factors in the nucleus can selectively activate the promoter that is tuned to respond to frequency modulations while prolonged nuclear accumulation would activate several promoters at the same time. Thus, frequency modulation is better suited than the other encoding modes to allow the identification of external stimuli without requiring other mediators of the transduction.', 'published': 'NA', 'node': 43301, 'link_page': 'https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.06.511167v1?versioned=TRUE', 'link_pdf': 'https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.06.511167v1.full.pdf'}\n",

It remains unclear, however, if and how they affect gene expression. Here, we disrupted the formation of two prominent endogenous transcription bodies that mark the onset of zygotic transcription in zebrafish embryos and analysed the effect on gene expression using enriched SLAM-Seq and live-cell imaging. We find that the disruption of transcription bodies results in downregulation of hundreds of genes, providing experimental support for a model in which transcription bodies increase the efficiency of transcription. We also find that a significant number of genes are upregulated, counter to the suggested stimulatory effect of transcription bodies. These upregulated genes have accessible chromatin and are poised to be transcribed in the presence of the two transcription bodies, but they do not go into elongation. Live-cell imaging shows that the disruption of the two large transcription bodies enables these poised genes to be transcribed in ectopic transcription bodies, suggesting that the large transcription bodies sequester a pause release factor. Supporting this hypothesis, we find that CDK9, the kinase that releases paused polymerase II, is highly enriched in the two large transcription bodies. Importantly, overexpression of CDK9 in wild type embryos results in the formation of ectopic transcription bodies and thus phenocopies the removal of the two large transcription bodies. Taken together, our results show that transcription bodies regulate transcription genome-wide: the accumulation of transcriptional machinery creates a favourable environment for transcription locally, while depriving genes elsewhere in the nucleus from the same machinery.', 'published': 'NA', 'node': 49272, 'link_page': 'https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.21.517317v1?versioned=TRUE', 'link_pdf': 'https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.21.517317v1.full.pdf'}\n",

Although the current rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections has decreased significantly; the long-term outlook of COVID-19 remains a serious cause of high death worldwide; with the mortality rate still surpassing even the worst mortality rates recorded for the influenza viruses. The continuous emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs), including multiple heavily mutated Omicron sub-variants, have prolonged the COVID-19 pandemic and outlines the urgent need for a next-generation vaccine that will protect from multiple SARS-CoV-2 VOCs.\\n\\nMethodsIn the present study, we designed a multi-epitope-based Coronavirus vaccine that incorporated B, CD4+, and CD8+ T cell epitopes conserved among all known SARS-CoV-2 VOCs and selectively recognized by CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells from asymptomatic COVID-19 patients irrespective of VOC infection. The safety, immunogenicity, and cross-protective immunity of this pan-Coronavirus vaccine were studied against six VOCs using an innovative triple transgenic h-ACE-2-HLA-A2/DR mouse model.\\n\\nResultsThe Pan-Coronavirus vaccine: (i) is safe; (ii) induces high frequencies of lung-resident functional CD8+ and CD4+ TEM and TRM cells; and (iii) provides robust protection against virus replication and COVID-19-related lung pathology and death caused by six SARS-CoV-2 VOCs: Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma or P1 (B.1.1.28.1), Delta (lineage B.1.617.2) and Omicron (B.1.1.529). Conclusions: A multi-epitope pan-Coronavirus vaccine bearing conserved human B and T cell epitopes from structural and non-structural SARS-CoV-2 antigens induced cross-protective immunity that cleared the virus, and reduced COVID-19-related lung pathology and death caused by multiple SARS-CoV-2 VOCs.', 'published': 'NA', 'node': 74123, 'link_page': 'https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.24.541850v1?versioned=TRUE', 'link_pdf': 'https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.24.541850v1.full.pdf'}\n",

    "    \"abstract\": \"Transcription factors bind DNA in specific sequence contexts. In addition to distinguishing one nucleobase from another, some transcription factors can distinguish between unmodified and modified bases. Current models of transcription factor binding tend not take DNA modifications into account, while the recent few that do often have limitations. This makes a comprehensive and accurate profiling of transcription factor affinities difficult.\\n\\nHere, we developed methods to identify transcription factor binding sites in modified DNA. Our models expand the standard A/C/G/T DNA alphabet to include cytosine modifications. We developed Cytomod to create modified genomic sequences and enhanced the Multiple EM for Motif Elicitation (MEME) Suite by adding the capacity to handle custom alphabets. We adapted the well-established position weight matrix (PWM) model of transcription factor binding affinity to this expanded DNA alphabet.\\n\\nUsing these methods, we identified modification-sensitive transcription factor binding motifs. We confirmed established binding preferences, such as the preference of ZFP57 and C/EBP{beta} for methylated motifs and the preference of c-Myc for unmethylated E-box motifs. Using known binding preferences to tune model parameters, we discovered novel modified motifs for a wide array of transcription factors. Finally, we validated predicted binding preferences of OCT4 using cleavage under targets and release using nuclease (CUT&RUN) experiments across conventional, methylation-, and hydroxymethylation-enriched sequences. Our approach readily extends to other DNA modifications. As more genome-wide single-base resolution modification data becomes available, we expect that our method will yield insights into altered transcription factor binding affinities across many different modifications.\",\n",
